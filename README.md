Yo

I make things that I want to and basically nothing else.

Currently hosting the modpack "The Inventorium"
Can answer questions related to it and TF2C modding as a whole, just expect general incompetenece.

Contact me by going to the dark side of the moon (I'll be there, trust.)
Or, if you want something simpler (coward) talk to me on discord @clockstealer

That's all you need to know. Get out. (Affectionate)
